# Retrobot

Retrobot is a Slack bot that allows you to play NES/SNES/GB/GBA games with your friends over chat! Think "TwitchPlaysPokemon", but with GIFs. It accepts button presses, emulates the result, and encodes a GIF to view.

## Input Assist

Retrobot simplifies control by auto-forwarding through idle parts of games, such as conversations or battle animations.

Additionally, numbered buttons are added to automatically repeat button presses. This is useful for walking in a specific direction for a long period.
